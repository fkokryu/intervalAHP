    "**1) General Solution of the Logistic Map**\n",
    "The logistic map is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    x_{n+1} = 4x_n(1 - x_n)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with the initial condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    x_1 = \\sin^2\\theta.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we use the transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    x_n = \\sin^2\\theta_n.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, substituting into the logistic map equation,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\sin^2\\theta_{n+1} = 4\\sin^2\\theta_n(1 - \\sin^2\\theta_n) = \\sin^2(2\\theta_n).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the recurrence relation for \\(\\theta_n\\) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\theta_{n+1} = 2\\theta_n.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since \\(\\theta_1 = \\theta\\), it follows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\theta_n = 2^{n-1}\\theta.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the general solution is:\n",

    "**2) Fractal Dimension of the Generalized Koch Curve**\n",
    "For a standard Koch curve, at each iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The line segment is divided into \\(N = 4\\) parts.\n",
    "- Each segment is scaled by a factor of \\(s = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "The fractal dimension \\(D\\) is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    D = \\frac{\\log N}{\\log (1/s)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting \\(N = 4\\) and \\(s = 1/3\\),\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    D = \\frac{\\log 4}{\\log 3} \\approx 1.2619.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **generalized** Koch curve, if the transformation follows similar recursive principles but with different segment numbers or scaling factors, we apply the same formula with the specific values given in the lecture slides.\n",

    "**3) Physiological Interpretation of LF and HF Components in HRV**\n",
    "The heart rate variability (HRV) power spectrum is divided into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low-Frequency (LF) range (0.04–0.15 Hz):**\n",
    "  - Related to both **sympathetic** and **parasympathetic** nervous system activities.\n",
    "  - Influenced by **baroreflex** and blood pressure regulation.\n",
    "  - Often associated with Mayer waves in blood pressure fluctuations.\n",
    "- **High-Frequency (HF) range (0.15–0.4 Hz):**\n",
    "  - Primarily linked to **parasympathetic (vagal) activity**.\n",
    "  - Strongly correlated with **respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)**, where heart rate increases during inhalation and decreases during exhalation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a healthy individual, a balance between LF and HF power indicates a well-functioning autonomic nervous system.\n",

    "**4) Potential Applications of Wearable Sensors**\n",
    "Wearable sensors have numerous applications in healthcare, fitness, and daily life. Some potential applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous health monitoring:**\n",
    "  - Tracking vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.\n",
    "  - Early detection of arrhythmias or other cardiovascular issues.\n",
    "- **Physical activity and fitness tracking:**\n",
    "  - Step counting, calorie estimation, and movement tracking.\n",
    "  - Personalized workout recommendations.\n",
    "- **Sleep quality analysis:**\n",
    "  - Monitoring sleep stages, detecting sleep apnea.\n",
    "- **Real-time stress monitoring:**\n",
    "  - Measuring HRV and skin conductance to assess stress levels.\n",
    "- **Disease management:**\n",
    "  - Glucose monitoring for diabetics.\n",
    "  - Continuous EEG monitoring for epilepsy patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "An innovative idea could be the development of **multi-sensor smart clothing** that integrates ECG, temperature, and motion sensors for seamless real-time health monitoring.\n",

    "**5) Most Impactful Course Content and Its Significance**\n",
    "One of the most impactful topics in this course was **fractal analysis in biomedical signals**. The concept that seemingly chaotic biological signals, such as HRV and neural activity, exhibit **hidden fractal patterns** was fascinating. This realization deepens our understanding of physiological systems, showing that their complexity follows mathematical principles rather than being purely random.\n",
    "\n",
    "This topic was impactful because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It provided insight into **how fractal properties can be used for disease detection**, such as detecting arrhythmias through HRV fractal dimension analysis.\n",
    "2. It demonstrated the **interdisciplinary nature of biomedical data science**, linking mathematical models with physiological phenomena.\n",
    "3. It offered potential real-world applications in **personalized medicine**, where fractal analysis could improve diagnostics and patient monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these principles enhances our ability to develop better analytical tools for biomedical research and healthcare applications.\n",
